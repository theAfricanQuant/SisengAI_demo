# Summary of Discussions

## Key Participants
- **Instructor**: Ricky Macharm
- **Participants**: 
  - Habeeb Yomi Ayanwole
  - Ramon Taiwo

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Python Programming**
- Created Python scripts for various tasks:
  - **ChatGPT-Assisted Prompts**:
    - A script to convert currency using exchange rates fetched from an API.
    - A script to check divisibility by 3, 5, and 7 using mathematical properties.
    - A script to generate time-series data using NumPy’s random number generator (RNG) and plot it with Matplotlib.
  - **Code Provided by You**:
    - A polar plot script sourced from a website, which was cleaned and enhanced to ensure proper functionality:
      ```python
      import numpy as np
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

      r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
      theta = 2 * np.pi * r

      fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
      ax.plot(theta, r)
      ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
      ax.grid(True)

      plt.show()
      ```
  - **Your Original Idea**:
    - A task to generate a Pandas DataFrame with dates and random data, plotting it as a time-series chart.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
- Generated visualizations using Matplotlib:
  - A time-series plot with random data spanning 100 days.
  - A polar plot using `theta` and `r` coordinates.

### 3. **Environment Management**
- Discussed Python environment setups (`Conda`, `.venv`, `uv`) in VS Code:
  - Selecting the interpreter via the Command Palette.
  - Configuring the default environment in `settings.json`.
  - Installing and managing packages with `uv`.

### 4. **Package Installation**
- Installed essential packages using `uv`:
  - `ipykernel`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

### 5. **Tools and Libraries**
- Explored libraries and tools like:
  - **NumPy**: For random number generation and numerical computations.
  - **Pandas**: For creating and manipulating DataFrames.
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

### 6. **Task Challenges**
- Provided tasks to practice:
  - Generating random numbers with NumPy’s `default_rng()`.
  - Creating a Pandas DataFrame with random data and plotting it.
  - Experimenting with polar plots and cumulative sums for trends.

## Example Outputs
- **Time-Series Plot**: Created a chart showing random data over 100 days.
- **Polar Plot**: Generated a circular plot with `theta` and `r` coordinates.

## Attribution of Code Prompts
- **ChatGPT Helped Code Prompts**:
  - Currency conversion script.
  - Divisibility checker script.
  - Random data time-series generation and plotting.
- **User-Provided Code**:
  - Polar plot script sourced from a website and cleaned.
- **User-Initiated Idea**:
  - DataFrame with dates and random data for a time-series chart.

## Feedback and Next Steps
- Explore further practice with:
  - Automating tasks with Python (e.g., file manipulation, data preprocessing).
  - Experimenting with advanced data visualization techniques.
  - Deepening understanding of package and environment management using `uv` and other tools.
