# Summary of Discussions

## Key Participants
- **Instructor**: Ricky Macharm
- **Participants**: 
  - Habeeb Yomi Ayanwole
  - Ramon Taiwo

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Python Programming**
- Created Python scripts for:
  - Currency conversion using exchange rates.
  - File renaming with timestamps to automate tasks.
  - Math tricks like divisibility checks for numbers.
- Demonstrated the use of NumPy’s random number generator (RNG) for generating time-series data and plotting it with Matplotlib.
- Explained how to select and set up Python environments (Conda, `.venv`, `uv`) in VS Code.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
- Generated a polar plot using Matplotlib with a simple example.
- Created a time-series plot with random values associated with dates using NumPy and Pandas.

### 3. **Environment Management**
- Discussed how to manage Python environments (`Conda`, `.venv`, `uv`) in VS Code:
  - Selecting the interpreter via the Command Palette.
  - Configuring the environment in `settings.json`.

### 4. **Package Installation**
- Installed essential Python packages using `uv`:
  - `ipykernel`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

### 5. **Tools and Libraries**
- Covered Python libraries such as:
  - **NumPy**: For random number generation and numerical computations.
  - **Pandas**: For creating and handling DataFrames.
  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting data.

### 6. **Task Challenges**
- Provided tasks to practice:
  - Generating random numbers with NumPy’s `default_rng()`.
  - Creating a Pandas DataFrame with random data and plotting it.
  - Experimenting with polar plots and cumulative sums for trends.

## Example Outputs
- **Time-Series Plot**: Created a chart showing random data over 100 days.
- **Polar Plot**: Generated a circular plot with `theta` and `r` coordinates.

## Feedback and Next Steps
- Explore additional customizations for:
  - Automating common Python tasks.
  - Enhancing data visualizations with advanced techniques.
  - Further practice with `uv` for package and environment management.
